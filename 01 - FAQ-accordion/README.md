## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

First time in months that I touched basic CSS and HTML since I've been learning backend and React. Took about 7 hours, which is 5 hours longer than I thought, I had to have a lot of reminders but it was good practice. Getting the plus buttons to the right took longer than I want to admit, as well as getting the keys to navigate the questions.


### Continued development

I want to improve my CSS and JS skills. Mostly I want to deal with CSS faster than my current speed. I don't need to become an expert in it, but I want to not have to google for simple and easy properties.
